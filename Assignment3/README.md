  <h1>NumPy</h1>

  <h2>Purpose</h2>

  <p>
    The purpose of this in-lab is to introduce you to python package NumPy. NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
    To understand the concepts of the python package NumPy and familiarize yourself with the concepts of NumPy.  


  <h2>Partners</h2>

  <p>
    You are encouraged to work with one other partner on this assignment.
    If you work with a partner, you must both be in the same lab section.
    Put your names at the top of your assignment and include your lab section.
  </p>

  <h2>Preliminaries</h2>

  <p>
    Create a project named <b>Lab3FirstLast</b> on your lab computer.  Place the following files into this project <a href="futbol.py"> futbol.py</a> and modify it to the best of your ability. If you implemented everything correctly running <a href= "futbol.py"> futbol.py </a> should have the following output <a href= "futbol.txt"> futbol.txt</a>
    </a>
  </p>

  <h2>Assignment</h2>

  <p>

  </p>

  <p>
    In this assignment, you will be asked to use the NumPy python package.  NumPy has alot of built in functions and in this assignment, you will utilize and become familiar with how they work.  Cristiano Ronaldo is a Portuguese professional Futbol player. He has been playing professionally from 2003-Present and has had quite the remarkable playing career. In this assignment, you will be asked to calculate numerous statistics from his playing career using the NumPy python package.  
  </p>

  <ul>
    <b><li>Task1:</b>
    <b><ol>Task1.1 </b> First calculate the max amount of goals that Ronaldo has made in one year.</ol>
    <b><ol> Task1.2</b> Then calculate the maximum amount of goals that he has made in League, Cup, and in European Futbol.</ol>
    <b><ol>Task1.3</b> Now calculate the minimum amount of goals that Ronaldo has made in one year.</ol>
    <b><ol>Task1.4</b> Lastly calculate the Minimum amount of goals that he has made in League, Cup, and in Europe Futbol.</ol>
    </li>
    <b><li>Task2:</b> Calculate how many years that Ronaldo has made zero goals in each competition. <b>Hint:</b> Use the nonzero function of NumPy. </li>
    <b><li>Task3:</b> Calculate the total number of goals for each competition in his whole career. Then calculate the average amount of goals for each competition that Ronaldo has played in. </li>
    <b><li>Task4:</b> Use the NumPy package to create a matrix. Then insert the goals for League, Cup, and in Europe Futbol in each row. </li>
    <b><li>Task5:</b> Build a new matrix made from the total number of goals of the second and third year of League and Cup. Then print those two numbers with the titles <b>"League: second and third year"</b>, and <b>"Cup: second and third year"</b>.  </li>

  </ul>

  <p>  
  </p>


  <h2>Submission</h2>

  <p>
    Before lab ends, e-mail a copy of <b>Lab3FirstLast.java</b> to your
    lab TA.  The subject of the e-mail should be CSCI 111, Lab 3,
    your lab time, your name, your partner's name at the top of your document.
    To receive credit, this e-mail must be sent before your
    lab period finishes.  Partial credit can be earned, but late
    assignments will not be accepted.
  </p>

  <h2>Grading - 10 points possible</h2>

  <ul>
    <b><li>2 points.</b> One point will be given for correctly calculating the amount of goals that Ronaldo made in one year, and the max amount of goals that he has made in League, Cup, and European Futbol. One point will be given for correctly calculating the minimum amount of goals that Ronaldo made in one year, and calculating the minimum amount of goals that he has made in League, Cup, and European Futbol.  </li>

    <b><li>2 points</b> One point will be given for correctly calculating the total amount of goals. One point will be given for correctly calculating the average amount of goals.
    <b><li>2 points.</b> One point will be given for correctly using the NumPy package to build a matrix. One point will be given for inserting the goals for the three competitions into the matrix.</li>
    <b><li>2 points.</b> One point will be given for correctly building a new matrix for the number of goals for League and Cup in the second and third years. One point will be given for printing the second and third year goal totals.</li>
    <b><li>1 points.</b> One point will be given for adding comments explaining implementation of your program.</li>
