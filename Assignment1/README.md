  <h1>Data Types</h1>

  <h2>Purpose</h2>

  <p>
    The purpose of this in-lab is to introduce you to the concept of data types in python.
    To understand the concept of data types.
    To familiarize yourself with basic numeric data types in python.
    </p>

  ### Examples of Data types


  <li>Simple Python Types: int(eger), float, str(ing)</li>
  <li>Determining Type: type
  <li>Declaring and Using Variables</li>
  <li>Assignment Token: =</li>
  <li>Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, //, %, ** </li>
  <li>User Input: input</li>



  <h2>Partners</h2>

  <p>
    You are encouraged to work with one other partner on this assignment.
    If you work with a partner, you must both be in the same lab section.
    Put your names at the top of your assignment and include your lab section.
  </p>

  <h2>Preliminaries</h2>

  <p>
    Create a project named <b>Lab1FirstLast</b> on your lab computer.
    Place the following files into this project <a href="data_types.py"> data_types.py
    </a>
  </p>

  <h2>Assignment</h2>

  <p>
  Many websites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram ask for your personal information. In this lab, you will use data types to build a registration form which will hold your personal information. Such as your first name, last name, height, weight, eye color, and shoe size.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this assignment, you are going to build a personal data program.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <b><li>Task1:</b> Your modified program should use float variables to store the height and weight. </li>
    <b><li>Task2:</b> Calculate how many characters are in your full name.</li>
    <b><li>Task3:</b> Introduce two new variables height_cm and weight_kg of the type integer, convert your height/weight from inch/lb into the metric system (centimeters/kilograms). <b>hint: </b>The height should be an integer and the weight should be a float. cm=in x 2.54.  kg=lb x 0.453592 </li>
    <b><li>Task4:</b> Calculate the body mass index (BMI = mass/height) and introduce a new float variable to save it. <b>hint:</b> Calculation: [weight (lb) / height (in) / height (in)] x 703. </li>
    <b><li>Task5:</b> Print a summary that contains all the information above.
    <b><li>Task6:</b> Add comments explain the variable/data type conversions your program is implementing.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  </p>


  <h2>Submission</h2>

  <p>
    Before lab ends, e-mail a copy of <b>Lab1FirstLast.py</b> to your
    lab TA.  The subject of the e-mail should be CSCI 111, Lab 1,
    your lab time, your name, your partner's name at the top of your document.
    To receive credit, this e-mail must be sent before your
    lab period finishes.  Partial credit can be earned, but late
    assignments will not be accepted.
  </p>

  <h2>Grading - 10 points possible</h2>

  <ul>
    <b><li>2 points.</b>  Two points will be given for correctly using float variables to store the height and weight. </li>
    <b><li>2 points.</b>  Two points will be given for correctly calculating how many characters are in your name. </li>
   <b> <li>2 points.</b>  One point will be given for introduction of the two new variables in type integer. One point will be given for converting height/weight, inch/lb, and (centimeters/kilograms) </li>
    <b><li>2 points.</b>  One point will be given for calculating the BMI. One Point will be given for introducing a new float variable.  </li>
    <b><li>1 points.</b>  One point will be given for printing a summary.  </li>
    <b><li>1 points.</b>  One point will be given for adding comments explaining implementation of your program. </li>


  </ul>
