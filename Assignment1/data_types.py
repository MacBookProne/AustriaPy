full_name = input("Enter your full name: ") #string

height_inch = input("Enter your height (inch): ")
weight_lb = input("Enter your weight (lb): ")

color_eyes = input("Enter your eye color: ")
color_hair = input("Enter your hair color: ")

#task 1:    your modified program should use float variables to store the height and weight

#task 2:    calculate how many characters your full name has:
#len_full_name =

#task 3:    intruduce two new variables height_cm of the type integer and weight_kg of the type float
#           convert your height/weight from inch/lb into the metric system (meters/kilograms) and save the result into the corresponding variables
#height_cm =
#weight_kg =

#task 4:    calculate the bodymassindex and introduce a new float variable to save it
#           hint: Calculation: [weight (lb) / height (in) / height (in)] x 703
#bmi =

#task 5:    print a summary containing all information above
print("Summary:")
print("Full name : ", full_name)
#to be continued...

#task 6:    add comments explaining the variable/data type conversions your program is doing
