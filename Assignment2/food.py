# In the file food.py you'll need to implement a class called Food.
# A Food object should have the instance variables a name and calories, which are assigned by the constructor.
# Write getter functions for those variables called, getName(self) and getCalories(self).
# Turning a Food object into a string should return a string in this format: "[name] has [calories] calories."
# Turning a Food object into an integer should return the calories of that object.
# Adding Food objects should return the sum of the calories. (Hint: implement __radd__ and __add__).
# Food objects should be comparable (by calories), for that overload the <,>,==,!=,<= and >= operators.
