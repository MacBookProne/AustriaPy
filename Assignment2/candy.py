from food import Food
# The file candy.py should contain three classes

# The class Candy should inherit from Food.
# The constructor of the class Candy should also take a name and calories 
# and then run the constructor of its parent Food with those arguments.
# Turning a Candy object into a string should return a string in this format: 
#"[name] is candy and has [calories] calories."


# The class Snickers should inherit from Candy
# and the constructor should call the Candy constructor with the name "Snickers" and 488 calorie


# The class KitKat should inherit from Candy
# and the constructor should call the Candy constructor with the name "KitKat" and 518 calories.
