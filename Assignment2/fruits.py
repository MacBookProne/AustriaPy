from food import Food

# The file fruits.py should contain three classes:

# The class Fruit should inherit from Food.
# The constructor of the class Fruit should also take a name and calories
# and then run the constructor of its parent Food with those arguments.
# Turning a Fruit object into a string should return a string in this format: "[name] is a fruit and has [calories] calories."


# The class Apple should inherit from Fruit
# and the constructor should call the Fruit constructor with the name "apple" and 52 calories.


# The class Banana should inherit from Fruit
# and the constructor should call the Fruit constructor with the name "banana" and 94 calories.
