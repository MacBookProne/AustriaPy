  # Final Project

  </head>

  <body>

  <h1>Pandas</h1>

  <h2>Purpose</h2>

  <p>
    The purpose of this final project is to have you use Python language constructs and modules that you have learned throughout the semester to accurately complete this final lab.
    To show a complete understanding of the concepts and constructs of the Python programming language. The main focus of the assignment will be on Pandas, but will also include concepts from throughout the semster.



  ## Partners

  <p>
    You are encouraged to work with one other partner on this assignment.
    If you work with a partner, you must both be in the same lab section.
    Put your names at the top of your assignment and include your lab section.
  </p>

  <h2>Starting materials</h2>

  <p>
    Download the <a href="movies.py">movies.py</a> file onto your lab computer.
    You will also need to download <a href="movie_metadata.csv">movie_metadata.csv</a> and place it in the same folder.
    Lasly, download <a href="sample_output.txt">sample_output.txt</a> to see example output for all the tasks.
  </p>

  <h2>Final Project</h2>

  <p>
    In this assignment, you will be using python Pandas library to manipulate data from a CSV file. The data that you will be manipulating holds information from over 5000 movies in IMDB. How can we tell what the greatest movie of all time is? You will be able to anwser this question once you have completed this final project. For this assignment, you will be writing your code in the provided movies.py file.
  <ul>
    <b><li>Task1:</b> Start by implementing the functions <b>new_csv()</b>. import_csv() is used to import the file <a href="movies.csv">movies.csv</a> which is a cleaned up version made by new_csv() from the original  <a href="movie_metadata.csv">movie_metadata.csv</a> file. The new csv file will only contain columns that are used in the rest of the program.
    <b><li>Task2:</b> Next implement the function <b>top10movies()</b> which will give back the top 10 movies of all times ranked by either budget, gross, IMDB score, or facebook likes, depending on the user choice. The top 10 ranking must be printed in a neat manner within python shell.
    <b><li>Task3:</b> Now write the function <b>showMovieInfo()</b> that will print out the information for a specfic movie such as "Interstellar", for example. The summary should tell the user who directed the movie, where the movie was released, the year it was made, the budget for the film, how much of a profit it made, the IMDB score, and the amount of likes that it has on Facebook.  </li>
    <b><li>Task4:</b> Implement the function <b>analyseMovies()</b> which will prompt the user for a Country and a Year, and then based on that print a short summary about the movies filmed in that country in the specified year. The summary should contain at least: Number of movies filmed, movie with largest budget, and movie with smallest budget. </li>
    <b><li>Task5:</b> Lastly, implement the function <b>topDirectors()</b> which will print out a list of 10 directors that directed the most movies. It will also print out information about the movies which that director directed: average budget, average imdb score, and average number of likes</li>
    <b><li>Note:</b> You will find more informations on the functions in the comments in the starting code.</li>
  </ul>

    <b><li>25 points.</b> Task 4 </li>
    <b><li>25 points.</b> Task 5 </li>
    <b><li>10 points.</b> Ten points will be given for adding comments explaining implementation of your program. </li>
